"Supplemental Data Set 2B. Degradation rates for 1228 Arabidopsis proteins  and statistical analysis across samples. All proteins in this list have:  1) protein identification probability >0.95; 2) peptide probabilities >0.80; 3) at least five independently quantified peptides used for the protein degradation rates calculation; 4) data for the overall protein degradation rates calculation arising from at least three independent biological samples. The Arabidopsis gene indices (AGI) and descriptions are from TAIR, the concensus subcellular location is from SUBAcon (suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au) and functional bins (bincode and binname) from MapCave (mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapcave).  The SN column combines subcellular location (Px peroxisomal, Cyt cytosolic, PM plasma membrane, Pt plastid, Et extracellular, ER endoplasmic reticultum, Nc nucleus, Mt mitochondrial) with a high level level binname grouping for each protein. The left hand block of columns shows the labeled protein fraction (LPF) ratio for each protein in each of 27 samples (3 days x 3 leaves x 3 biological replicates). Number of peptides quantified from relative isotope abundance to form a Labelled Protein Fraction (LPF) measure is shown in #Quanted, SD is standard deviation of the LPF in the sample. The middle block of columns shows the conversion of these LPF values to degradation rates and the averaging of these rates across replicates within a leaf type.The final block of colums shows: the average degradation rates for proteins across all leaf types; the separation of proteins based on protein degradation rate into fast, intermediate and slow categories; the relative standard error in degradation rate for each protein; the number of peptides used in calculations; the number of samples of the 27 from which data were obtained and whether or not a protein was observed not to change in abundance over time in the subsequent quantification experiment.
